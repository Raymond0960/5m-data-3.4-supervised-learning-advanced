# Lesson

## Brief

### Preparation

We will be using the `ml` environment for this lesson.

### Lesson Overview

This lesson introduces regularization, hyperparameters evaluation and tuning. We will also explore more advanced supervised learning models such as decision trees, random forests, and gradient boosting.

## Part 1 - Advanced Supervised Learning

We will be using the `notebooks/supervised_learning_3_lesson.ipynb` notebook throughout this lesson.

> 1. Activate the environement `conda activate ml`.
> 2. Run `jupyter notebook`.
> 3. In the notebook, open `notebooks/supervised_learning_3_lesson.ipynb`.
> 4. Follow on with the lesson in the notebook.
